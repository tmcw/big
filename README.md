This is a ridiculous presentation system that works great for
creative, hurried people. See [the demo](http://macwright.org/big/demo.html)
for an example of it working.

It makes text and images as big as they can be, gives you minimal
styling (`em`), and gives you left/right arrows for navigation.

## Quickstart

You can skip every step by doing

    wget https://raw.github.com/tmcw/big/gh-pages/big.quickstart.html

This is a **bundle of all JS, CSS, and HTML code** - which means that it's
a bit harder to update, but there are **no external dependencies** here,
so no conference-wifi-pwn.

# Stuff that works with big

* [bigclicker](https://github.com/tmcw/bigclicker) is a remote control for big
* [bigpy](https://github.com/harperreed/bigpy) lets you use Markdown with big by implementing it as a pre-processing step in Python
* [big-themes](https://github.com/tmcw/big-themes) ([website](http://macwright.org/big-themes/#0))
is a fledgling new repository for big themes. Try one, make one, take one home
today.

## Open Source

* Big is awesomer because [lambda](https://github.com/lambda), [mikeal](http://github.com/mikeal), and [BraulioVM](https://github.com/BraulioVM) contributed to it! And you can too: it's Public Domain, CC0.
* mdznr [has a really cool fork](https://github.com/mdznr/big) with [its own demo](http://mdznr.github.com/big/#0)

## HTML5

Big is totally HTML5! It uses the HTML5 doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`!
It's therefore imbued with standardslicious hypeclouds.

## Source

The source looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title></title><link href='big.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /><script src='big.js'></script></head><body>
<div>Big</div>
<div><em>Presentation software</em> for busy busy hackers</div>
<div>text</div>
<div>as <em>big</em> as it can be</div>
<div>no config</div>
<div><em>1.5k</em></div>
<div><em>images too</em></div>
<div><img src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/5757000880_509440308e_z.jpg' /></div>
<div>JS+CSS <a href='https://github.com/tmcw/big'>github.com/ tmcw/ big</a></div>
```

## 'features'

* If you put an image as the first thing in a slide, it'll become a tiled background. I abused this power in
  [my presentation on project it yourself](http://macwright.org/presentations/projections/#0)
* You can swipe left & right on mobile devices to go back and forth.
* If you put something like 'time-to-next="5"' as an attribute in a slide, the slide will pass after 5 seconds.
