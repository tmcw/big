<div>Good evening.</div>
<div>This is the thirty-seventh time I have spoken to you from this office.</div>
<div>where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of this nation.</div>
<div>Each time. I have done so because of a matter that I believe affected the national interest.</div>
<div>Of all the decisions I have made in my public life. I have tried to do what is best for the nation.</div>
<div>Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate.</div>
<div>I have felt that it is my duty to persevere. To make every possible to complete the term in office. to which you elected.</div>
<div>In the past few days. however. it has become evident to me. that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress.</div>
<div>to justify continuing that effort.</div>
<div>As long as there was such a base. I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the Constitutional process through to its conclusion.</div>
<div>To do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process.</div>
<div>and a dangerously destabilizing precedent to the future.</div>
<div>But with the disappearance of that base.</div>
<div>I now believe that the Constitutional purpose has been served. and that there is no longer a need for the prolonging of that process.</div>
